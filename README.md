## Run locally

- Create `.env` file with the following:

```
PGUSER=<username>
PGHOST=localhost
PGDATABASE=<databasename>
PGPASSWORD=<yourpassword>
PGPORT=5432
```

- if the name is between `<>` replace with your own credentials
- if PGPORT is not set it will use default value of 5432
- PGPASSWORD does not have to be set if you don't have a password
